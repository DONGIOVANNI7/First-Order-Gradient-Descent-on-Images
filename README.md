# First-Order-Gradient-Descent-on-Images
1st Order Gradient Descent on Images! 

Based on the following repository: https://github.com/DONGIOVANNI7/0-order-Gradient-Descent-on-Images, 
we modify the code, in order for the algorithm to be First Order Gradient Descent on the image! 
The code takes an input image, applies transformations and optimizations using gradient descent,
 and saves the optimized image that closely resembles the reference image based on the chosen similarity function.
